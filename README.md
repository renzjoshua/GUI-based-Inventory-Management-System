# GUI-based-Inventory-Management-System

The product intends to help the clients who are having a hard time in keeping and updating the record and track of their inventory. It lets the users add, edit, delete, search, and access the data of the items that are included in the inventory. Users may also categorize a certain item, input its description and status, and access its history. The GUI-based Product Inventory System stores the following information: Employee’s Details, Item Description, and Item History. The first one will include the employee’s name, contact number, username, and password. Next, the second information will include item title, category, description, and remarks/status. Lastly, Item History will include remarks, status updates, and manager comments. This product is a replacement for existing Product Inventory Management systems.
